# Machine-Learning---Ensemble

I. Prepare data analysis:
1. Load the data into Dataframe. The dataframe should have data and column description
2. Ensure the attributes types are correct. If not, take appropriate actions
3. Transfor the data - scale/normalise the data if required
4. Create the training set and test set in 70:30 ratio

II. Create ensemble model:
1. Write python code using scikitlearn, pandas, numpy, and others in jupyter notebook to train and test the ensemble model.
2. First create a model using standard classification algorithms   the model performance
3. Use appropriate algorithms and explain why that algorithms in the comment lines.
4. Evaluate model. Use confusion matrix to evaluate class level metrics i.e. Precision and recall. Also reflect the overall score of the model.
5. Advantages and Disadvantages of the algorithms.
6. Build the ensemble models and compare the results with the base model. Note. Random forest can be used only with the Decision Tress.

III. Tuning the model:
1. Discuss some of the key hyper parameters available for the selected algorithm. What values did you initalise these parameters to.
2. Regularisation techniques used for the model.
3. Range estimate at 95% confidence for the model performance in production.
